### ABOUT  

 This project presents a unique approach to improve the prediction accuracy of a particular cardiovascular illness - "The Coronary Artery Disease" by using machine learning techniques to identify key features.
Several feature combinations and well-known categorization methods are used to introduce the prediction model. Using the Logistic Regression (LR) as the prediction model for heart disease, an improved performance level with an accuracy rate of 82% has been achieved. Working with more accurate datasets can improve the accuracy rate further.
